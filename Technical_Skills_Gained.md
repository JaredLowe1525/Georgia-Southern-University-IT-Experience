# Technical Skills Gained

My work at Georgia Southern University strengthened a wide range of technical competencies central to enterprise IT environments.

I developed strong troubleshooting skills for classroom AV systems, including DMPS transmitters, projectors, control panels, and video routing. These tasks required understanding signal paths, hardware dependencies, and rapid recovery techniques.

Endpoint support became a core skill set. I regularly confirmed hardware failures versus configuration issues, tested power and data paths, replaced components, and coordinated workstation imaging or reimaging when required. This reinforced structured diagnostic thinking and system validation.

Printer and print server administration was another major area of growth. I verified network connectivity, validated printer IP configurations, checked status pages, and ensured devices were properly added to centralized print servers before user deployment.

User access support included password resets, permission configuration, Wi-Fi onboarding, and application-level access troubleshooting. I gained experience translating technical actions into clear explanations for nontechnical users.

Equally important were documentation and process skills. I created repeatable procedures for common tasks such as reimaging and software cleanup, enabling faster resolution and smoother handoffs between technicians.
