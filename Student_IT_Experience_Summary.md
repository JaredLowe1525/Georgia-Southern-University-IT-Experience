# Student IT Experience Summary

Working on the Georgia Southern University IT team provided hands-on exposure to enterprise-scale IT operations through high-volume, time-sensitive support tickets. My responsibilities spanned classrooms, offices, and labs, where uptime and rapid resolution were critical to academic continuity.

A large portion of my work involved classroom technology support, including resolving projector failures, AV routing issues, and control system outages while classes were actively in session. These scenarios required rapid triage, structured troubleshooting, and clear communication with instructors under time pressure.

I also supported endpoint systems by diagnosing hardware failures, replacing faulty cables or peripherals, reimaging workstations, and restoring functionality after system or software corruption. This work reinforced the importance of standardized imaging processes and validation steps to ensure reliable deployments.

Software remediation was another recurring responsibility. I performed clean removals and reinstalls for applications such as Adobe Creative Cloud, resolving licensing and startup issues through documented, tool-driven procedures. These tasks emphasized attention to detail and repeatability.

Throughout my time on the IT team, ticket documentation was treated as a professional deliverable. Each resolution required clear notes, reproducible steps, and proper escalation when necessary. This experience transformed individual tickets into structured operational knowledge and strengthened my ability to work within enterprise IT processes.
